        <p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are increasingly being used in land
            surveying.
            Drone
            surveys involve using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to carry out a survey. It has
            borought a revulationary change in treditonal land measuring process. Besides elemenating a huge numbers
            of
            cons of treditional land measuring process, they also offer several advantages over traditional
            methods.Drones can gather data from locations that are inaccessible to people, particularly those with
            difficult terrain. The drone can fly over an area and collect the same amount of data in less time than
            human operators could by personally measuring sites in dangerous areas.

        <h1 class="intro">A DRONE SURVEY: WHAT IS IT?</h1>
        <p>
            Let's define land surveying first in order to properly understand drone surveying. The science of
            identifying or re-establishing the borders, lines, corners, locations, distances, and monuments of real
            estate or land is known as land surveying. Using drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data
            or information for use in land surveying is known as a drone survey. Drones equipped with LiDAR payloads,
            RGB cameras, and multispectral cameras may take several pictures of a survey location from various
            perspectives. Using photogrammetry software, the data can subsequently be used to produce 3D models or
            georeferenced orthomosaic maps of the project area. These maps can be used to obtain extremely precise
            volumetric measurements or distances by a field surveyor. Drones can produce high-resolution, extremely
            precise data in real-time at a lower cost than human aircraft or satellite imagery. Drones can also fly
            practically anywhere, allowing them to collect data in dangerous or inaccessible locations. </p>

        <p>
            RGB and multispectral cameras on drones are used to take aerial photos of a project area from above the
            ground. LiDAR payloads are another element of drone systems that aid in data collection, particularly when
            determining an object's precise distance inside a specific area. During a land survey, a drone will fly over
            the project area and capture pictures of the land from various perspectives using its cameras. Every image
            that was taken has the precise coordinates of the location. </p>

        <h1 class="intro"> HOW ARE DATA COLLECTED BY DRONES?</h1>
        <p>

            Drones are mostly used to collect data from a Geographic Information System (GIS) computer system. They
            mapped out and visualized locations using this knowledge. Drones can, however, be outfitted with additional
            instruments for gathering data when doing field surveys. Drones used to be able to transfer data, but they
            could only record it. All of the data has to be retrieved by the operator. Drones may now send data in
            real-time and even convert unprocessed data into useful information thanks to GIS technology. </p>

        <h1 class="intro"> ARE DRONE SURVEYS ACCURATE?</h1>
        <p>
            The accuracy of drone surveys is a common concern for beginners in the field. However, it is important to
            note that drones are known for their high level of accuracy. In most cases, drone survey results can be
            expected to have an accuracy of approximately 2-3 centimeters horizontally and 5-6 centimeters vertically.
            By utilizing a top-of-the-line drone under optimal conditions, it is possible to achieve even greater
            accuracy, reaching levels as precise as 1 centimeter (0.4 inches) horizontally and 0.7 centimeters/pixels
            (0.3 inches/pixels) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD). It is worth mentioning that the accuracy of a drone
            survey is influenced by various factors, including the type of drone being used, the quality of the camera,
            the altitude at which the drone is flown, the nature of the ground cover, and the technology and methodology
            employed in geolocating the aerial images. Fortunately, obtaining highly accurate survey results is now
            easily achievable with the availability of high-quality commercial drones in the market. </p>

        <h1 class="intro">WHY ARE DRONE SURVEYS BETTER COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL METHODS?</h1>
        <p>Drone surveys offer several advantages over traditional methods. Firstly, drones are capable of quickly
            capturing topographic data, making the process five times faster compared to land-based methods. This
            efficiency allows for significant time savings, as there is no need for additional manpower to achieve the
            desired survey outcomes. Additionally, the use of PPK geotagging eliminates the need for numerous ground
            control points, further streamlining the data collection process.

            Furthermore, drones have the ability to access and collect data from vantage points that are typically
            challenging or inaccessible to humans. Harsh terrains, steep slopes, and inaccessible areas no longer pose
            limitations when using drones for surveying purposes. This eliminates the need to close down streets or
            highways to perform surveys, as drones can capture data from above.

            In terms of data accuracy and comprehensiveness, drone surveying surpasses traditional methods. While
            traditional surveying methods, such as total stations, generate individual point measurements, drones
            produce a greater number of measurements that can be represented in various formats, including DTM, DSM,
            point cloud, contour lines, and orthomosaic. Additionally, each map generated by a drone contains 3D
            geo-data, providing a more detailed and comprehensive representation of the surveyed area.

            Despite these advantages, it is important to consider the disadvantages of using drones in surveying. One
            such drawback is the confusing and ever-changing drone regulations, particularly in cities or urban areas.
            Additionally, it is crucial to hire experienced and well-trained professionals to operate the drones, as
            inaccurate results may occur if operated by unskilled individuals. Moreover, drones may not be suitable for
            use in areas that frequently experience high winds, as this can affect their stability and data collection
            capabilities.

        <h1 class="intro"> WHAT KINDS OF DRONES ARE USED FOR SURVEYING?</h1>
        <p>Various types of drones are utilized for surveying purposes. In the current market, there is a wide array of
            commercial drones available for purchase. When selecting a drone for surveying tasks, it is essential to opt
            for one that possesses the necessary features to effectively carry out the required job. While drones with
            multirotor configurations are common, those equipped with fixed-wing motors are more suitable for mapping
            surveys. Although operating a multirotor drone may be less complex, a fixed-wing drone is better suited for
            conducting surveys over extensive areas of land. Fixed-wing models have the advantage of prolonged flight
            durations compared to multirotor models, making them the preferred choice for large-scale surveys.
            Additionally, it is advisable to choose a drone with autonomous flight capabilities, as this allows for
            efficient and repetitive aerial mapping. In the absence of autonomous flight features, users can manually
            create a flight path using specialized software and program the drone for pre-determined flights. Given the
            necessity to cover vast expanses of land during aerial mapping, it is crucial to select a drone with
            sufficient battery capacity to sustain continuous flight operations. Opting for a drone capable of hovering
            for at least 30 minutes to an hour without interruption is recommended to avoid time wastage associated with
            frequent recharging or battery replacements. Furthermore, it is important to select a drone equipped with a
            high-quality camera capable of capturing 12 MP images and 4k videos for 3D mapping tasks. Such cameras are
            essential for photogrammetry applications, which rely on geotagged images to extract surface dimensions and
            generate detailed data sets.

        <h1 class="intro">WHAT KINDS OF DELIVERABLES CAN YOU ACHIEVE WITH DRONE SURVEYING?</h1>
        <p>Different types of deliverables can be achieved through the use of drone surveying, depending on the specific
            software, camera, and sensor being utilized. One such deliverable is a LiDAR point cloud, which allows for
            data collection in areas with dense vegetation or other obstacles. This point cloud provides a detailed and
            accurate model for measuring area, volume, and distance.

            Drones can also generate thermal maps, which can be used to identify areas with abnormal heat signatures.
            This is particularly useful for surveying cities, campuses, military bases, and other facilities. By
            conducting drone inspections, it is possible to monitor various infrastructure elements such as steam pipes,
            water mains, and condensation return lines.

            Another type of data that can be collected through drone surveying is a multispectral map. This technique
            involves capturing images within specific wavelength ranges on the electromagnetic spectrum. Multispectral
            maps are valuable for gaining insights into agriculture and crop management.

            Furthermore, drones can be used to produce 3D models of surveyed areas. By scanning the site and collecting
            relevant data sets, drones enable the creation of comprehensive 3D models using specialized software. This
            facilitates more in-depth site analysis, particularly for large objects like buildings and construction
            sites.

            Lastly, drones can generate 3D orthomosaic maps, which address issues with 2D projection. By capturing
            numerous images and compiling them into a 3D map, drones provide land surveyors with improved topographic
            data. These 3D orthomosaic maps can be integrated with Building Information Modeling (BIM) in construction
            surveys, allowing for the identification of discrepancies between the high-resolution 3D map and BIM objects
            at each construction stage.
